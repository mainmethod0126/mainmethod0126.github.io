# introduction

This is a gradle plugin that helps you easily do semantic versioning of java projects using gradle

## Reason for production

In the team I work with, we do not use Docker and instead deploy the .jar files directly. Because of this, we encountered situations where it became confusing to know which version a specific .jar file was during deployment, especially when the file itself didn't contain version information.

To address this, I decided to create a versioning library for .jar files that would be beneficial for all team members.
