# introduction

It's a service that helps find specific annotations used in a project.

## Reason for production

I encountered a situation in a Java project where I needed to find classes that are using a specific annotation. I thought creating a simple feature similar to Spring Framework's component scanner could be very useful in many cases, so I decided to give it a try.
